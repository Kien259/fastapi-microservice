## 📊 Architecture Diagrams

### High-Level AWS Integration
The solution uses multiple AWS services in an integrated manner:

```
Users (SEA) → ALB → EKS Cluster → RDS PostgreSQL
                     ↓              ↓
                Background Workers → ElastiCache Redis
```

### Data Flow Pattern
```
API Request → Authentication → Business Logic → Database/Cache
                                    ↓
              Background Task → Queue → Worker Process → Database Update
```
